# Customer persona
## Who's the customer
### The individual
### Their context 
### Their needs
> We identify an individual for whom we are innovating. This can be a specific role, title or targeted user profile. What we want to understand is who is the individual that has a challenge that requires an innovation for the challenge to be solved? what time of day does this challenge occur? Where are they when this challenge occurs? 
What do they have that's a pain or frustration in their life that requires this need? And is this need an emotional need or a functional need? Rayford Davis, Digital Innovation AWS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFdpBqmDpzM
